# Sorting-Visualizer

A sorting visualizer project based on HTML, CSS and JS.
<br>

## Overview

A web-application where users can input a list of numbers, and the program visually demonstrates the sorting process using different algorithms. Allow users to interactively choose sorting methods, providing a dynamic and educational experience in understanding algorithmic sorting.

## Features

- Visual representation of popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- Dynamic visualization that allows users to interactively see the sorting process on randomly generated data sets.
- Adjustable speed controls for visualizing sorting algorithms at different speeds.
- Separate web pages for analyzing the Space and Time complexity of sorting algorithms.
- User-friendly interface for an intuitive experience.
